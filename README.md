Foosha is a foodsharing app designed for mobile use. 

It is a project which was created within one week at Codeworks software engineering immersive bootcamp, and it will be developed further by collaborators wihthin this course.

## Collaborate

To collaborate, fork this repo and clone it into a local repository. Run `npm install` from client and server separately.
The client is started by running `npm run dev` from the client root folder. 
To connect your own database, you might want to adapt `server/model/index.js` locally.

### Ideas for further development

- Sorting conversations by newest message and highlight unread messages
- Mark conversations when the corresponding food item is no longer available
- Add badges to the food items regarding dietary preferences
- Convert Javascript to Typescript
